# PCA_tSNE_Automobiles
The goal of this project was to reduce the dimensionality of data consisting of features of automobiles to extract meaningful insights. I use PCA and tSNE to do so.


I want to mention that PCA was also used as part of my genetics project. I am happy to go into detail about that project and how it was used to help our team so please ask me about it if you are curious!
